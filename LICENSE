Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This is a free software license. There are many ways to comply with the terms of this license; they are all equivalent, since they all protect the user's freedom.

You may copy and distribute this software as you receive it, verbatim, with the copyright and license notice intact.

You may distribute this software under the terms of this license along with a cover letter of your own, stating that you distribute it without warranty; and that recipients may redistribute it under the terms of this license.

Add an appropriate copyright notice to each modified file, stating that you created those modifications.
Add a copy of this license to the modified work, along with a prominent notice that the work was modified under the terms of this license, and an explanation (or pointer to one) of what the changes were.
Distribute the modified work in a way that permits the recipient to replace it with an unmodified copy of the software, or a copy modified under the terms of this license, at any time.
If you distribute a part of the software that is essential to the operation of the software as a whole, and if the distribution of that part is accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the recipient the source code of the entire software for a reasonable price on request by the recipient, then you are not required to distribute the source code of that part.
